# **Module Challenge # 15: leaflet-challenge** 

## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization. 

### **Background:**
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) plays a crucial role in providing scientific data about natural hazards, ecosystems, and environmental health, with a particular focus on the impacts of climate change and land-use alterations. Although the USGS collects vast amounts of earthquake data from around the globe, they currently lack effective tools for visualizing this data in a meaningful way. In this challenge, your task is to create a tool for visualizing USGS earthquake data, helping to better educate the public, inform government organizations, and potentially secure additional funding for the USGSâ€™s vital work.

### **Module Challenge Description:**

The goal of this module challenge is to develop an Earthquake Visualization, specifically a Basic Map that enables better visualization of earthquake data from the past 7 days. The final map should display earthquake data by using marker size to represent magnitude and color to indicate depth, with interactive features such as popups for additional information and a legend for context. This dataset will be provided in JSON format, and the challenge will focus on the following skills:

- Leaflet Integration: Create a map using Leaflet to plot earthquakes based on 
their longitude and latitude.

- Visual Adjustments: Adjust marker size to reflect the earthquake's magnitude and color to represent depth. Larger markers should indicate stronger earthquakes, while darker colors should reflect deeper earthquakes.

- Interactive Popups: Include popups that provide detailed information about each earthquake when the corresponding marker is clicked.

- Legend Creation: Add a legend to the map to give users context for the displayed data.

By completing this challenge and applying the skills outlined above, an interactive, informative, and visually engaging map will be developed, enhancing the accessibility and understanding of earthquake data.
